# Sort

Extension for nova.app that allows you to perform simple sorting on highlighted text.

![usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisdl/nova-sort/master/usage.gif)

# Usage

Currently you can sort in 4 different ways:

  - Sort multiple lines based on a regular 0-9a-z sort.
  - Sort one or more lines internally. For example a line saying `cba` will say `abc`.
  - Sort multiple lines based by length (the number of characters including whitespace).
  - Sort multiple lines based on length but reversed.
